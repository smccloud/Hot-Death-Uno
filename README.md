# Hot-Death-Uno
Hot Death UNO is an UNO add-on/variant that incorporates some House Rules with 27 (or more depending on the variant) extra cards that allow you to remove players from the game, draw up to 69 cards at once, have them display their cards for all to see, and more! Favorites include Mystery Draw, Harvester of Sorrows, and Mutual Assured Destruction.

This is a labor of love for me (started by someone else, I found it on Windows Mobile devices, then Android, then wanted it again when I cam back to Android), as I have enjoyed the original Hot Death Uno for many years. I wish I had more specifics about who invented it, but I first saw it in electronic form in the mid 90s, as a Visual Basic application for Windows. I ported it to Pocket PC in the early 2000s, and now it is here for Android.
